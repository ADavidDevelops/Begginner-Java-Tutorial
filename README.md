# Begginner-Java-Tutorial - CodeSparks /+/ David
This is a complete course (100% Commeted) explaining everything from the youtube video series by codesparks (My channel)
this will teach you the basics of java even if you have no prior coding knownage (Some things might seem slow if you do but its for newbies too)
About me,
I'm a 15-Year-old Software developer with 4+ Years of experience working in languages like Java, C++, PHP, Html/CSS, C#, Javascript, MySQL + SQL, And many Frameworks,
Now I wish to share my knowledge and hopefully get more of you (My audience) into Software Development & Robotics (A New Hobby),
Becoming a patron will give you sneak peaks on what I'm working on & Some of my closed source code!
Anything i release to my patron will eventually be released to the public so nothing is closed knowledge.
You will also get Support from me in any coding problem you have,

Notice: New tutorials will take time with each one taking 2-3 hours
