		/*
		 JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is the virtual machine that executes java bytecode.
		 It does not understand Java source code,
		 which is why you compile your .java files into .class files that are understandable by the JVM. 
		 The JVM and the functionality involved is why Java is known as the "write once, run anywhere" language. 
		 It has implementations for different systems and aims to achieve the same results regardless of what system the bytecode is run on.

		JRE (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE contains the libraries,
		the JVM, and any other components needed to run applications written in Java. 
		Two other technologies are also included in the JRE: Java Plug-in, which allows applets to run in popular browsers, 
		and Java Web Start, which deploys standalone applications over a network.

		JDK (Java Development Kit): The JDK contains everything contained in the JRE,
		 plus tools like compilers and debuggers specifically for developing applets and applications.

		Object: An object is essentially a container for a set of states/behaviors and methods 
		to interact with them. For example, a dog has several different states - fur color, name,
		 breed and behaviors like barking or eating. An object is an instance of a Class.

		Class: A class is sort of like a template for Objects. 
		It's where you define the behaviors and states that the object of that type contains,
		and where you can define default values for states. Keeping with the dog example,
		a Class would be where you would say "a dog has fur color which defaults to brown, 
		a name that you define when creating a new dog", etc.

		Methods: A method is the behavior of the object. T
		his is where the logic is written and where states/data is manipulated.

		Instance Variables: The 'states' of objects we've been talking about are defined with instance variables. 
		These serve the purpose of keeping track of what states any particular object is in at any given time.

		Constant: A constant is a variable whose value does not and cannot change. 
		These are most often prefixed with "final", and are also often declared static as well.
