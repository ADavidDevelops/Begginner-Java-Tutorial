		 * This will print something out to the console, System will grab the system of course,

		 * out means we will be getting the output stream, Anything the console sends out (Error messages, our messages) will happen via the output stream,
		 * println means it will print a message on a new line, you can also use print but it won't break into a new line
		 * rounded brackets hold parameters, in this case, println(), we will have examples of using this in the next tutorial
